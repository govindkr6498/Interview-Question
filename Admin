1. What is difference between SOQL and SOSL?
==> SOQL Stands for Salesforce Object Query Language.
==> Retrieve the records from the database by using "SELECT" keyword.
==> We can access 50k recors in single SOQL.
==> In single transaction we can perform 100 SOQLs.
==> We can retrieve from single  object or from multiple object that are related to each others.
==> It ican be used in classes and trigger.
==> DML Operation can we performed on Query results.
==> Return records.
==> Record are store in collection.Records are pertaining to single sObject.
==> SOQL against the same field will be slow.


==> SOSL stands for salesforce Object Search Language.
==> Retrieve the records from the database by using the "FIND" keyword.
==> We ca retieve the 2k records in SOSL.
==> In single transaction we can perform 20 SOSLs.
==> We can retieve multiple objects and fields values effeciently when the objects may or may not be related to each other.
==> It can use in classes but not in triggers.
==> DML Operation can't be performed on search results.
==> Rsturn fields.
==> Records are pertaining to different sObject.
==> We can query on multiple tables.
==> All field are already text indexed.


2. What is order of execution in salesforce?
==> A set of rules that describe the path, a record takes through all 
    automations and the events that happen from SAVE to COMMIT.
	

3. Order of Execution.

==> Older value are overwritten.
==> System validation Rule(Page Layout specific Rules/Field Formate,Maximum Length)
==> Execute before record-trigger flows.
==> Execute all before Apex triggers.
==> Run Custom validation Rule.
==> Execute Duplicate Rules.
==> Save the Records to the Database, but doesn't commit yet.
==> Executes all after triggers.
==> Assignment Rule
==> Executes auto-response rules.
==> Execute workflow rules.
==> Execute after record trigger flow.
==> Rollup summary formula update.
==> Commit all DML operations to the database.
==> Execute all after-commit logic.

After the commit Logic.
==> Run all asynchronous Apex (Trigger → Queueable → Future → Batch)


4. What is Role and Profile?
==> Roles provide access to records visibility for the users.
==> it is a record -level access.
==> It follow a hierarchy. Data visible permission are given based on hierarchy.
==> The role is always depand on the profile.
==> optional for users. depanding on the need for record-level security.
==> Roles controler acess to record and field only.

==> Profile provide acess controlnof CRED record of the users.
==> It is an Object and field-level access.
==> It does not follow any hierarchy.Permissions are given based on the profile.
==> The profile can be independent of the role.
==> Profiles are mandatory for users.
==> Profile controler acess to objects,field-level security layouts,record types, and apps.



5. What is profile?

==> It controls object-level security,field-level security, and permissions like 
	CRUD(Create,Read,Update,Delete),record types, and page layouts.

6. What is a Role?
==> Role is part of Role hierarchy which determines record-level access. 
==> It helps define data visibility for user and allows sharing of records based on hierarchy.

11. How to delete a user in Salesforce?
==> Users cannot be deleted in Salesforce. You can deactivate or freeze them.

12. What is deactivated and freeze user?
==> Deactivate a user permanently removes their access to salesforce, but their data(record,ownerships,etc) remains.
==> User can not be logged in after deactivation.
==> Releases the user's license, so it can be assigned to someone else.
==> Some references(like approval processes) may need to be reassigned before deactivating.


NOTE: When Deactivate?
	1. When an employee leaves the company.
	2. When you need to free up a license.
	
	
==> Freezing a user temporarily blocks their access. but their license remains assigned.
==> user can not login  but their license is still occupied.
==> Does not release the license.
==> Freezing can be done without deactivating the user.

NOTE: When to Freeze?
	1. When a user is under investigation (Security concerns)
	2. When an employee ison temporarily leave.
	
13. Governor Limits.
==> Governor limits are runtime restrictions enforced by salesforce to ensure efficient resource usage in a multi-tenant environment.


==> CPU time per transaction 			--> 10 seconds (synchronous) / 60 seconds (async)
==> Heap size per transaction 			--> 6 MB (synchronous) / 12 MB (async)
==> Max records fetched by SOQL	    		--> 50,000 records
==> Max SOQL queries per transaction  		--> 100 queries
==> Max DML statements per transaction 		--> 150 statements
==> Max callouts per transaction		--> 100 callouts (HTTP, SOAP, REST)
==> Max future method calls			--> 50 per transaction

15. What are the different Types of Relationships in salesforce?
==> Lookup Relationship
==> Master-Detail Relationship
==> Many-to-Many Relationship (Achieved using a Junction Object)
==> Hierarchy Relationship 
==> Self Relationship

16. What is Lookup Relationship in Salesforce?
==> A Lookup Relationship create a parent-child relationship between two objects without dependency.
==> If the parent record is deleted, the child remains.


17. What is Master-Detail Relationship?
==> A Master-Detail Relationship creates a tightly linked parent-child relationship
==> If the parent is deleted, the child is also deleted.
==> Roll-Up Summary fields allowed(Sum,Min,Max,Count).
==> Mandatory Relationship --> A Child record must have a parent.
==> Child record inherits security & ownership.

Example: 
	Opportunity (Master) and Opportunity Line Items (Detail).

18. What is a Junction Object in Salesforce?
==> A Junction Object enables a many-to-many relationship between two objects.
==> A junction object is a custom object with two master-detail relationships, and it is the key to making a many-to-many relationship.
Example:
	==> OpportunityLineItem (Opportunity Product)	==> Opportunity	 ==> Product
	==> PricebookEntry	==> Pricebook  ==> Product
	==> CaseSolution	==> Case	==> Solution

19 . There are two objects both are lookup relationships, I am trying to delete a parent. if the parent has a child object. then I don't want to delete it. how to achieve it?
==> One radio button is available on the lookup field.
	"Don't allow deletion of the lookup record that's part of a lookup relationship.".


20. Can we convert a Lookup Relationship into a Master-Detail Relationship?
==> Yes, but only if all child records have a parent record.


21. What is Flow in Salesforce?
==> Flow is a visual automation tool that allows users to create complex workflows, interact with records, and data operations.


22. How many types of salesforce flow?
==> Screen flow
==> Record Trigger Flow

24. What is Change Set in Salesforce?
==> Change Sets are used to deploy metadata changes(Objects,Fields,Workflows,etc)

25. What is a Data loader?
==>  Data Loader is a tool to insert, update, delete and export data in bulk CSV files.
==> Insert, Update record maximum 5 million.
==> Work on All Objects


26. What are Sandbox in Salesforce?
==> A Salesforce is a copy of a Salesforce org used for development and testing.
==> Types
	==> Developer  --> Full Metadata, No Data
	==> Developer Pro --> More Storage
	==> Partial Copy --> Some Data & Metadata
	==> Full --> Entire org copy
	
	
27. What are the Audit fields?
==> Audit Fields track record history and include:
	==> CreatedBy
	==> CreatedDate
	==> LastModifiedBy
	==> LastModifiedDate
	

28.  How did you convert 15 digits into 18 digit id?
==> By using function CASESAFEID(Id)


29. I want to delete the account record. how many ways to show an error message to user?
==> 1. Validation Rule (ISNEW() = FALSE)
    2. Trigger
    3. Reocrd Trigger Flow (Before Delete Record-Triggered Flow)
    4. Lightning Web Component (LWC) or Aura Component
	
	
30.  Can we call Lwc from flow?
==> Yes! You can call a Lightning Web Component (LWC) from a Flow using a Screen Flow


31. In real real-time scenario when you decide to use a trigger whether flow?
==> Simple Record Automation: Updating related records, sending emails, or making field updates.
==> Before-Save Flows are 10x faster than triggers.
==> Use Flow for simple automation (e.g., field updates, email alerts).

==> Complex Business Logic: If-else conditions, loops, multiple record updates.
==> Bulk Processing Required: Handles large data volumes more efficiently.
==> Integration with External APIs: Callouts, external system interactions.
==> Handling Recursive Operations: Prevent infinite loops when records update each other.
==> Multiple Related Object Updates: If multiple objects need updates in one transaction.


32. How to decide to use before save and after save flow?
==> Before Save:
	1. When you only need to update fields on the same record 
	2. Executes before the record is saved to the database

==> After Save
	1. Use when you need to update related records or send email notifications.
	2. Executes after the record is saved to the database (like after insert & after update in Apex Trigger).
	3. Supports DML operations (Insert, Update, Delete, Callouts, Email Actions, etc.).
	4. Sending an email notification after a record is created.
	5. Deleting a record
	6. Custom Roll-Up Summary


33. How Many Ways Can We Make a Field Required in Salesforce?

	5. Using Record Types & Page Layouts
	6. Using Apex Trigger (addError)

34. In how many cases we can make a field read-only?
==> Field-Level Security (FLS)
==> Page Layout
==> Record Type + Page Layouts
==> Validation Rule
==> Using Flow (Screen Component)
==> Apex Trigger.

35. What is whoID and whatID? 
==> WhoId and WhatId are polymorphic lookup fields that are commonly used in activities like Tasks and Events. They help associate records with different types of objects.

==> WhoId refers to People (Human records).
It is used for Contacts or Leads.
Example: If you schedule a meeting with a Lead or Contact, the WhoId will store the Lead ID or Contact ID


36. WhatId refers to Things (Non-human records).
==> It is used for Accounts, Opportunities, Cases, Campaigns, or Custom Objects.
Example: If you log a call related to an Opportunity or Case, the WhatId will store the record ID of that object.



37. How many ways to create a rollup summary field 
==> Standard Roll-Up Summary Field.
==> Apex Trigger
==> Process Builder & Flow


38. What is the difference between IsBlank and s Null?
==> ISBLANK(expression)	Checks if a field is empty or blank	Text, Number, Date, Picklist	Works for both Text and Number fields
ISNULL(expression)	Checks if a field has a NULL value	Only Number, Date, Checkbox	Does not work for Text fields
