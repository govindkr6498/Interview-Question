#. Apex Class:
--------------
==> Salesforce Apex is a programming language used to develop custom 
	functionalities and business logic in the Salesforce platform. 
	Think of it as a tool that allows developers to create custom solutions
	that are specific to a particular businessâ€™s needs within the Salesforce
	environment.
	

# Use of Salesforce Apex:
-------------------------
==> With Salesforce Apex, developers can create custom objects, automate business processes, 
	create custom user interfaces, and integrate Salesforce with other systems. 
	In simple terms, Apex is a way to extend the capabilities of the Salesforce platform to 
	meet the unique needs of a business.
	
#. OOPs Concept
---------------
1. Object
2. Class
3. Abstracttion
4. Inheritance
5. Polymorphism
6. Encapsulation


#. Object:
----------
==> Any real-world entity that has a state and behavios is
	known as object. for example:
	Chair, Pen, table, Bike, keybord.
	
==> it can we physical or logical.
==> A cat is an object because it has color, height, and weight
	as state and speak, walks, and sleeps as behavior.
	
==> A table or chair is also an object because it has color, height, widht, etc.


#.Class:
--------
==> A class is a collection of object.
	EX:
		Vechicles, Tree, Animal.

==> Class can also be defined as blueprint from which we can create 
	multiple individual objects.



#. Abstraction:
---------------
==> Hiding internal(Implementation) details and exposing/showcasing only 
	the functionalities in known as abstraction.
	
==> for example tv, We don't what happens behind the scene.


#. Inheritance:
---------------
==> When a child object acquires all the properties(variable/methods) from a parent
	object then it is called as inheritance.
	
	
	
#. Polymorphism:
----------------
==> When the same task is done in different way then it is known as polymorphism.
==> When one task can be done in a different way its called polymorphism. Let say
		we can make tea and cofee with some milk.
	EX:
	---
		Speaking,Walking,convncing, customes, playing,youtube session, teaching.
		

#. Encapsulation:
-----------------
==> Wrapping hiding/code(Putting together) and data together into a single unit is 
	known as encapsulation.
	
==> Binding the data together in a single unit is called Encapsulation.

	
	
===================================================================================================================

#. Data Type:
=============
1. Primitive Data Type
2. Non-Primitive Data Type

#. Primitive Data Type:
-----------------------
==> Primitive data type contain only one value, like 23, true, 2024-04-24, etc.
==> Primitive data type specify the size and type of variable value.

1. Integer --> A whole number without a decimal point.
2. Double --> A number with a decimal point or a fractional component.
3. Boolean --> A data type that can have one of two possible values - true or false.
4. Date --> A data type that represent a date.
5. Time --> A data type that represent a specific time.
6. DateTime --> A data type that represent a specific date and time.
7. String --> A sequence of character that can include letters,numbers, and Symbols.
8. ID --> A unique identifier for an object in salesforce.(18,15) charcater.
9. Decimal --> A number with a decimal point, with up to 18 digits.



#. Non-Primitive Data Type:
---------------------------
==> Non-primitive data types can contain multiple values or complex data 
	like a set, list, map,Object.
	


#. Class in Salesforce:
=======================
1. Access Modifiers
2. Variable
3. Methods
4. Constructor



#. Access Modifiers:
--------------------
==> Access modifiers in salesforce are used to define the visibility 
	and accessibility of classes,methods,variables and other components
	within an organization.

==> There are three types of access modifiers in  salesforce
1. Public:
----------
==> Components with the public access modifiers are visibile and accessible to
	all classes and triggers in an organization.This means that any class or trigger
	in the organization can access and use these component.
	
2. Private:
-----------
==> Components with the private access modifiers are only visibile and
	accessible within the same class in which they are defined.This means
	that no other class or trigger in the organization can access or use 
	these components.
	
3. Protected:
-------------
==> Components with the protected access modifiers are visibile and
	accessible within the same class and any subclass that extend the
	original class. This means that any class that inherits from the 
	original class can access and use these components.

	EX:
	---
		Class A (Parent)
			1. Protected variables
		
		Class B(Child) extend Class A(Variable $ methods)
			1. Class
				1. Variable
				2. Methods
		
		

#. Variable:
------------
==> Variables in Salesforce are used to store and manipulate data within 
	apex code.

	EX:
	---
		Integer myAge = 5;
		Decimal mySalary = 76.78;
		String myName = 'John Doe';
		
	
	
======================================================================================

#. Methods:
-----------
==> A method is a block of code that perform a specific task or action.
==> methods can be used to perform calcuulation,manipulation data,and
	interact with the salesforce platform, such as by creating,updating,
	or deleting records.
	
	EX:
	---
	
		public class TestMethodController {
			public static Integer calculateSum(Integer firstNum,Integer secondNum){
				System.debug(firstNum+secondNum);
				return  firstNum+secondNum;      
			}
			public static Integer calculateMul(Integer firstNum,Integer secondNum){
				System.debug(firstNum*secondNum);
				return  firstNum*secondNum;      
			}
		}
