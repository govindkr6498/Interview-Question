1. Best Practice and consideration for trigger?
Ans: a. One trigger per Object
	    b. Avoid SOQL Query inside for loop.
  	  c. Avoid DML inside for loop.
  	  d. Avoid Hardcoding Ids.
  	  e. Bulkify your code.
  	  f. Use where cluase in SOQL Query.
  	  g. Avoid nested for loop.
	 	 
2. How many records can be inserted in DML?
Ans: A list or map can not process more than 10000 DML rows in a single transaction.
==> We can't use more than 150 DML Statements in a single transaction.

3. How many records can be processed in trigger in salesforce.
Ans: Triggers are called with up to 200 records at a time.
==> A transaction ca include bulk DML on up to 10000 records, So
    Your trigger could be called 50 times.	
	
4. How to avoid recursion in Trigger.
Ans : 
	a. Use static Boolean Variable ==> this is good for 200 records.
	b. Use Static set
	c. Use Static Map

5. What are governor Limits? Give three examples.
Ans:
	Salesforce governor limits, they are set of rules and regulation that
	restrict monopolistic use of the resource for org that utilize salesforce servers.
	
	
	
6. What are the difference types of Exception in salesforce?
Ans:
	1. DMLException : 
		a. Any problem with DML
		b. Required Field Missing
		c. Mixed DML Operation Error.
		d. Invalid date.
		
	2. NullPointerException:
		a. A line of code that is trying to use an object that has not been 
		   instantiated, or an object's attributes that have not begun initialized.
		
	3. QueryException :
		a. Any problem with Soql queries, such as assigning a query that return
     	   no records or more than one record to a singleton sObject variable.
		
	4. Limit Exception:
		a. In Salesforce, we can encounter the salesforce Governor Limits. 
		   A governor limit has been exceeded. This exception can't be caught. 
		   This is a hard limit, which means you can't increase it by contacting Salesforce support.
		   
		   
		  
7. What are the types of collections in Salesforce, and when to use which type of collection?
Ans:
	1. List ==> A List is an ordered collection of elements.
			==> Lists are beneficial when preserving the data order or accessing 
				elements based on their position is necessary.
				
	2. Set ==> Sets are unordered collections that store only unique elements.
		   ==> Sets are useful when you need to ensure that your data is distinct 
			   and when you don't need to maintain order.
			   
	3. Map ==> A Map is a collection of key-value pairs. It's like a dictionary -each word(key) has a corresponding definition(value)
		   ==> When you need to seek values based on their associated keys, maps come in handy.
		   
		   
8. What is a wrapper class in Salesforce?
Ans: 	
	==> As the name suggests, a wrapper class in Salesforce allows 
	   developer to combine different data types and use them for specific purposes.
	   
	  
9. What is SOQL and SOSL? What are the differences between SOQL and SOSL?
Ans:
	1. SOQL(Salesforce Object Query Language)
		==> SOQL is a Salesforce Object Query Language, retrieves the records from the database by using SELECT keyword.
		==> SOQL is sued if we know in which object the data type is present.
		==> In SOQL, we can query data from single object as well as multiple objects that are related to each other.
		==> We can query all fields of any database.
		==> We can use SOQL in Triggers and class.
		==> We can perform a DML Operation on a query result.
	
	2. SOSL(Salesforce Object Search Language)
		==> SOSL is a Salesforce Object Search Language; retrieve the records from the database by using the FIND keyword.
		==> SOSL is used if we don't know in which object the data is present.
		==> We can retrieve multiple objects and field values efficiently when the objects may or may not be related to each other.
		==> We can use it in class but not in trigger.
		==> We cannot perform a DML operation on the search result.
		
	
10. What is the order of Execution in Salesforce?
Ans:
	==> A set of rules that describe the Path a record takes through all 
	    automatic and the events that happen from SAVE to COMIIT.
	
	1. Load the original Record from the Database/initialise for UPSERT.
	2. Older values are overwritten
	3. System Validation Rules.
	4. APEX Before Trigger.
	5. Custome Validation Rules.
	6. The record saved to the database is not committed.
	7. APEX after trigger.
	8. Assignment Rules.
	9. Auto Response Rules.
	10. Workflow Rule.
	11. Escalation Rules.
	12. Rollup Summary formule Updates.
	13. Execute Criteria-Based Sharing
	14. Database committed.
	15. Post Comit Logic.
