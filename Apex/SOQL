#. Fetch all Accounts that do not have Contacts.
==> SELECT Name FROM Account WHERE Id NOT IN (SELECT AccountId FROM Contact)



#. How do you find duplicate email addresses in Contacts using SOQL?
==> SELECT Email, COUNT(Id) FROM Contact GROUP BY Email HAVING COUNT(Id) > 1

NOTE : This retrieves email addresses appearing more than once.




#. What is the LIMIT and OFFSET in SOQL?
==> LIMIT restricts the number of records returned.
==> OFFSET skips a certain number of records.

Example:
	SELECT Id, Name FROM Contact ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC LIMIT 10 OFFSET 5

NOTE : This fetches 10 records, skipping the first 5.




#. How do you query related objects using SOQL?

	1. Child-to-Parent:
		SELECT Id, LastName, Account.Name FROM Contact
	
	2. Parent-to-Child:
		SELECT Name, (SELECT Name FROM Contacts) FROM Account




#. What are aggregate functions in SOQL? Provide an example.
==> SOQL supports aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), etc. Example:

	SELECT COUNT(Id), Industry FROM Account GROUP BY Industry
	
NOTE: This query counts the number of accounts grouped by industry.



#. Can SOQL queries have DISTINCT? Explain with an example.
==> Yes, DISTINCT ensures that duplicate values are removed:

	SELECT DISTINCT Name FROM Account
	
NOTE : This query fetches unique account names.



#. 10. Explain the difference between COUNT() and COUNT(Id) in SOQL.
==> COUNT() returns the total number of rows, including those without Id values.
==> COUNT(Id) counts only rows with non-null Id.

	SELECT COUNT() FROM Account
	SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM Account



#. What is the governor limit for SOQL queries in Salesforce? How do you optimize your queries?
==> 50,000 records can be returned by a query.
==> 100 synchronous queries per transaction.
==> Max query runtime 120 sec
==> Max rows processed in batch jobs 50 million

	Optimization Techniques:
		==> Use selective filters in the WHERE clause.
		==> Fetch only required fields.
		==> Use indexes for fields like Id or external IDs.
		==> Use Query Plan to analyze query performance.




#. How can you use polymorphic relationships in SOQL? Explain with an example.
==> In Salesforce, certain objects like Task and Event can be related to multiple other objects through polymorphic fields like WhoId and WhatId.
==> WhoId refers to Lead or Contact.
==> WhatId refers to standard/custom objects like Account, Opportunity, etc.
	
	Example 1: Fetch all tasks related to Contacts:
		SELECT Id, Subject, WhoId FROM Task WHERE WhoId IN (SELECT Id FROM Contact)


#. How do you use HAVING in SOQL?
==> SELECT AccountId, COUNT(Id) FROM Contact GROUP BY AccountId HAVING COUNT(Id) > 5


#. I want to access all account records in all fields.
==> SELECT FIELDS(ALL) FROM Account LIMIT 5
