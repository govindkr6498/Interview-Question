#. What is Lightning Web Component(LWC)?
==> LWC is a framework developed by salesforce for building web 
	aplication on the Salesforce plateform.It uses we standards 
	like HTML, CSS and Javascript to create reusable and high-performing
	component.


#. Explain the concept of data binding in LWC
==> Data binding in LWC establishes a connection between the
	component's javascript code and its HTML template. it enables 
	dynamic updates and synchronization of data between the component'salesforce
	properties and the UI.

#. How do you comminucattes between LWC components?
==> LWC provides various methods for component communication. These
	Include property binding for parent-child communication,events for 
	child-parent comminucation and the publish-subscribe pattern for
	communication between unrelated components.

#. How can you communication between parent and child component in LWC?
==> Communication between parent and child components in LWC can be achieved
	through property binding and event handling. The parent component
	can pass data to the child component using property binding, and the 
	child component	can notify the parent component of any events using 
	custom events

#. How do you handle error and exception in lWC?
==> Error handling in LWC can be done using try-catch blocks or
	leveraging the onError lifecycle hook. tou can catch exceptions
	and display appropriate error message to the user, ensuring a smooth
	user experience.
	
	
#. How do you handle user input in LWC?
==> LWC provides mechanism to handle user input, such as using event handlers,
	two-way data binding, and reactive properties. Event handlers can be used 
	to capture user actions like button clicks or input changes.
	
===========================================================================================	
	
#. What is decorator?
==> Decorator are design pattern that will be adding functionality
	into the properties and function in LWC.
	
==> There are three type of Decorator in LWC
	1. track
	2. Api
	3. Wire
==> @API decorator will be used to make these properties and function
	publicly available between component.
	
==> All public properties are reactive. Reactive means the framework
	observe the property for change.when property change value then
	the framework reacts and renders the component.


==> @Track decorator that will be making the property and the methods 
	as a private and property that can only be access within the 
	component only and can't be used outside the component.
	
==> @Wire decorator that will be used to call apex method and with
	the help of those apex method we can retrive the data and we 
	can show the data on the LWC component

==================================================================================================
	
#. Explain the life cycle hooks of an LWC component?
==> The lifecycle hooks of an LWC component refer to a series 
	of methods that are invoked during the time of component 
	creation , upate, and removal from the DOM.These method provide
	a way to interact and manipulate the component at different stages
	of its lifecycle.
	
	
	#. Creation:
	1. Constructor():
		==> This is the first hook to run when an instance of the component
			is created. It's where you initialize variable and set default values.
		
		==> Invoked when the instance of the component is created.
		==> fired in the parent component first since it flow from parent to child.
		==> you have to call super() inside first to call parent class constructor.
	
	#. Intialization:
	2. connectedCallBack():
		==> After the component is initialized, this hook is called.it's an
			Ideal place for DOM manipulation and data retrieval.
			
		==>Invoke when component inserted into DOM.
		==> it flows Parent to child.
		==> Used for to perfomr initialisation task such as fetch data, set upate
			cache, listen events.
		==> To check component is connected in DOM, use isConnected method.

			
	#. Rendering:
	3. renderedCallback():
		==> Use it to perform logic after a component has finished the rendering
		    phase. It invoked when a component is completely rendered on UI.
		==> Flow from child to parent component.
		==> Component rendered many times during tehre lifecycle, to track renderedBack(),
			use isRendered boolean field.
		==> Property leads to infinite loop in renderedCallBack().
		
	
	#. Reactivity:
		==> Whenever a property or variable changes in the component, it may
		trigger a reactivity cycle. During this cycle, the component checks 
		for changes in properties, and if changes are deacted, it re-renders 
		and invokes the "renderedCallBack" again.
		
	#. Destruction:
		4. DisconnectedCallback():
		==> When the component is removed from the DOM, this hook is called.
		    It's an excellent place for cleanup operations and releasing resources 
			like event listeners.
		 
		 ==> Called when the element is removed from a document(remove event listener, remove time interval etc)
		 ==> follow parent to child
		 
	#. Error Handling:
		5. ErrorCallback()
		==> If an erro occurs during rendering, this hook is invoked.
		    it provides an opportunity to fracefully handle error and 
			display appropriate message.
		
		==> Two argumewnts are passed in errorCallback(error,stack), the error
			argument is a Javascript native error object, and the stack argument
			is a string.

#. How to Send data from parent to child in LWC?
==> There are 3 ways to do it.
		1. Public Properties
		2. Public Function
		3. Public Properties with getter-setter
